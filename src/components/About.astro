      Hey 👋 there, I'm Rafid Muhymin Wafi, a passionate web dev from
      Bangladesh!
    </p>

    <p>
      I began my career as a <strong><em>Neobuxer</em></strong> (what?), then moved
      on to
      <strong><em>Pico Workers</em></strong> ( 😲 ) and finally decided to be a <strong
        ><em>Blogger</em>
      </strong> (oh, finally something good 😌)! When I started blogging, I used
      to spend more time designing the website than writing the content. I did it
      mostly to make my WordPress blog look nicer, but I never considered becoming
      a developer. Even I didn't know how to code!
    </p>

    <p>
      However, at the end of 2020, one of my cousins gave me hundreds of videos
      on web development from a course he purchased (clear piracy 🏴‍☠️!). I took
      his videos but I hadn't watched them in two months! I was barely
      interested! But then I realized that if I learned web development, I could
      better design my website! I decided to take the course and learn web
      development!
    </p>

    <p>
      But once I started watching the videos, it started to feel very
      interesting to me. And it occurred to me at that point that this is what I
      have the right skillset for and what I had been looking for for years.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been learning web development and building web apps since then. I
      later bought the course from Programming Hero and apologized to the chief
      trainer for committing piracy. He, thankfully, accepted my apologies and
      thanked me for informing him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the beginning of my web development journey I've been contributing
      to and maintaining open source projects and currently I'm one of the
      maintainers of the open source Astro JS project as well. My ambition is to
      build a better web. I'm looking for a full-time position where I will have
      the chance to fulfill my vision.
